# EASM-Scanner
This project provides a comprehensive solution for External Attack Surface Management (EASM). It uses masscan, Nmap, and WhatWeb to identify and analyze open services, and web technologies across a target network. The results are parsed into a SQLite db for analysis. A Grafana JSON model is also included for visualizing in a multi-panel dashboard.
